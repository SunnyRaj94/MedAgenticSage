      "\n",
      "**Monitoring:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Blood Glucose Monitoring:** Encourage the patient to monitor blood glucose levels at home, aiming for a target HbA1c <7%.\n",
      "2. **Lipid Profiles:** Monitor lipid profiles every 6-12 months to adjust statin therapy as needed.\n",
      "3. **Urinalysis:** Perform urinalysis annually to monitor for microalbuminuria or proteinuria.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Patient Education:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Diabetes Self-Management:** Educate the patient on diabetes self-management, including blood glucose monitoring and insulin administration (if necessary).\n",
